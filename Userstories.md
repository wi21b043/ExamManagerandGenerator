## ðŸ§  Notes & Constraints

- **Random logic:** Teacher defines how many questions per category to select.
- **Categories:** Created and customized by users.
- **Versioning:** Question history should be preserved, not overwritten.
- **Output:** Export format (PDF/Word/HTML) to be confirmed with supervisor.
- **Scope:** Focus on stable prototype before expanding functionality.
- **Collaboration:** Later integration with Microsoft Azure (when available).
