# Exam Manager and Generator

A lightweight tool designed to help teachers organize, manage, and generate exams efficiently.  
The system allows users to create question categories, store exam questions in a database,  
and automatically generate randomized exams based on selected settings.

## Project Overview

This project is part of the **Software Engineering Project (PRJ)** course at  
**Fachhochschule Technikum Wien (FHTW)**, under the supervision of **Regula Sutter**.

The goal is to build a practical, easy-to-use exam management system that:

- Stores exam questions in a database (SQLite)
- Organizes questions by topic, type, or difficulty
- Generates randomized exams based on teacher-defined parameters
- Allows manual editing and question replacement
- Exports exams to printable formats (e.g., PDF, Word, or HTML)

## Project Objectives

1. Develop a **small but stable prototype** before expanding to advanced features.
2. Focus on core functionality: question storage, categorization, and random exam generation.
3. Ensure usability without server maintenance or complicated setup.
4. Follow agile development with regular status meetings and feedback loops.
